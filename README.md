# HPMA115S0
Library for Honeywell's Particle Sensor (HPMA115S0-XXX)

This fork provides some minor debugging functionality (printing more information to the Serial Monitor). The debugging can be turned off by commenting out the line in src/hpma115s0.g

`// #define DEBUG`

An additional example with a hardware serial (for Arduino Mega) will be provided.
